## 4. Activity Logs

### Accessing Logs
Logs can be accessed in several ways depending on the environment:

1. **Windows Application**
   - Open Windows Event Viewer
   - Navigate to: `Windows Logs > Application`
   - Filter for events from "Rec Center Check-in" application
   - Logs are also visible in the application's console window if running in windowed mode

2. **Check-In Metrics CSV Log**
   - A dedicated CSV file is created for each day in `logs/checkins/` (on the server or app data directory).
   - The file is named as `MM-DD-YY-check-ins.csv` (e.g., `06-07-24-check-ins.csv`).
   - This file contains only check-in metrics, one row per check-in, in CSV format.

### Log Types
The application logs the following types of events:
- Search events
- Check-in events
- Waiver status changes
- Error messages and exceptions
- Square API interactions
- **Dedicated daily CSV file for check-in metrics (see below)**

### Example Log Lines

#### Customer Search
```
2024-03-15T14:30:22.123Z [ SEARCH ] Type: phone, Query: 5551234567
2024-03-15T14:30:22.234Z [ SEARCH RESULT ] Found 2 customers
```

#### Check-In Events
```
2024-03-15T14:35:00.456Z [ CHECK-IN ] Customer ID: ABC123, Guest Count: 2, First Name: John, Last Name: Doe, Lot Number: 123
```

#### Check-In Metrics CSV Log
- Each check-in is recorded as a row in a CSV file for the current day.
- The file is located at:  
  `logs/checkins/MM-DD-YY-check-ins.csv`
- The CSV columns are:  
  `timestamp,customerId,guestCount,firstName,lastName,lotNumber`
- Example:
  ```
  timestamp,customerId,guestCount,firstName,lastName,lotNumber
  2024-06-07T14:35:00.456Z,ABC123,2,"John","Doe","123"
  ```

#### Error Messages
```
2024-03-15T14:36:00.789Z [ ERROR ] Failed to search customers: Network error
2024-03-15T14:37:00.123Z [ ERROR ] Failed to update waiver status: Invalid customer ID
```

### Log Pattern Guide
- Timestamp format: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ`
- Action types in brackets: `[ ACTION ]`
- Customer IDs are alphanumeric
- Error messages include specific error details

### Troubleshooting
- For application errors, check Windows Event Viewer first
- For Square API issues, look for logs containing "[ ERROR ]" or "Square API"
- For check-in issues, search for logs containing "[ CHECK-IN ]"
- **For auditing or analyzing check-in activity, refer to the daily CSV files in `logs/checkins/`.**
