## 4. Activity Logs

### Accessing Logs
Logs can be accessed in several ways depending on the environment:

1. **Windows Application**
   - Open Windows Event Viewer
   - Navigate to: `Windows Logs > Application`
   - Filter for events from "Rec Center Check-in" application
   - Logs are also visible in the application's console window if running in windowed mode

### Log Types
The application logs the following types of events:
- Search events
- Check-in events
- Waiver status changes
- Error messages and exceptions
- Square API interactions

### Example Log Lines

- For check-in issues, search for logs containing "[ CHECK-IN ]"
