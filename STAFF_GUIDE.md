## 2. Customer Workflow

### Search Process
1. Customer selects search type (phone, email, or lot)
2. Enters at least 3 characters
3. Clicks search button
4. Selects their name from the results list

### Check-In Process
1. System displays customer's membership status:
   - "Member" if in "Membership 2025" Square segment
   - "Non-Member" if not in segment
2. System checks for "waiver-signed" custom attribute in Square:
   - If attribute exists and is true: waiver is considered signed
   - If attribute missing or false: waiver is considered not signed
3. If waiver is not signed:
   - System displays QR code for waiver signing
   - Customer scans QR code and signs waiver
   - Customer clicks "I have already signed" button
4. Customer selects number of guests from dropdown
5. Customer clicks "Check-In" to complete process

## 3. Troubleshooting
